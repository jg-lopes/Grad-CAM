# Grad-CAM

Implementation of the [Grad-CAM paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02391) using PyTorch's hooks.

The core structure for the notebook behind this work (sample images + pre-trained ResNet weights upon which GradCAM is applied to) were provided by the professors behind the [Deep Learning in Practice/Advanced Deep Learning](https://www.lri.fr/~gcharpia/deeppractice/index.html) class offered in the MSc of Data Sciences and Business Analytics by CentraleSup√©lec and ESSEC Business School.  

Both the Grad-CAM's implementation as well as additional comentary on the results are my own.
